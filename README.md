# Museum Guide App - Thesis by Malcolm Sävmarker

# Introduction

The digital world has quickly advanced and has changed the way we consume
information and interact with it. This is very much the case for museums,
where digital technology has played a vital part in making innovative ways
to display information in more interactive ways[1]. The Stedejik museum in
Amsterdam was the first place to use mobile guide technology in 1952[2]. A
museum experience in the traditional way had visitors walk around and read the
information on plaques. Digital guides have altered this experience, replacing
the information on the plaques with QR codes and geolocation to send audio
narratives to the visitor[3].
The field of digital technology has transformed the way we interpret the
world for the better concerning education and interactive experiences. With
the age of smartphones and mobile devices on the rise, museums have explored
ways to increase immersion and the ability to create interactive experiences.
For this to come to fruition, digital guide apps have been developed to provide
a convenient and simple way to learn about the exhibits of museums[4].
The design of a digital guide app using Flutter for the front-end and Firebase
for the back-end technology is of considerable interest. This is because it offers
a unique opportunity to explore how technology can be used to enhance the
museum experience. The guide app’s use of QR codes, geolocation, and text-
to-speech with translation will allow visitors to interact with exhibits and have
relevant audio tracks guiding them. Visitors should also be able to pause and
resume these audio tracks for others nearby. Finally, the evaluation of the group
and the enhanced museum experience will be done with the help of conducting
a prototype evaluation with the assistance of a workshop[5]. This will result
in valuable insight into how important design is to create digital tools that are
simple and accessible, as well as how to enhance the museum experience.
